# TWO's COMPLEMENT

Two's complement is one of several ways to represent negative numbers in the binary number system.
In order to represent negative numbers, we reserve the most significant bit to represent the
negative sign. A leading 1 will always mean the number is negative. Conversely, a leading zero means
the number is positive.

Using the two's complement makes it easy to add and subtract binary numbers. All we have to do is convert one of them to a negative (if they are both positive) and then add them. It also eliminates the needs to work with a "negative zero" as in the one's complement method.
